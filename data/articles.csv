2510.19912;"Systematics mitigation for catalogue-based angular power spectra";"Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra.";"data/articles/2510.19912v1.pdf";"Thomas Cornish";Professor
2510.20964;"Background solutions to the Hubble tension in f(Q) gravity and consistency with BAO measurements";"We test whether f(Q) symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity are capable of solving the Hubble tension while producing consistency with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three different forms for the f(Q) function: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We also consider extensions of these models by adding the Cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible double exponential addition to the standard ΛCDM H(z).";"data/articles/2510.20964v1.pdf";"José Antonio Nájera";Professor
