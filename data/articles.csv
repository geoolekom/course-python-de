2510.19912;"Systematics mitigation for catalogue-based angular power spectra";"Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra.";"data/articles/2510.19912v1.pdf";"Thomas Cornish";Professor
